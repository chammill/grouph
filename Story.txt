Far into the future of earth's existence, Humans has drained the earth of most of its natural
resources.Food resources has now been limited. Water has become a non-renewable resource.
Plants and trees are very hard to come by since they all have been chopped down and used for fuel
or compost.The only plants are in man-made greenhouses in populated cities.
There are many abandoned cities throughout the world because of the food shortages. 

A Scientist that goes by the name of Aster Scott has created an AI to help restore the earth of
its resources. It would tear down the abandoned cities and recycle the materials used and plant trees
and food to jump start nature again. After he was created into an AI,he began tearing down cities
and restoring some of earth's natural resources at the abandoned cities.

But a few months later, he began tearing down populated cities.This left many humans dead or homeless
in a world where resources and cities are hard to come by. OtherCities are taking precautions to
stop the AI. A scientist named Daisy Stuart created another AI to replace
Robert. Rosa as now entrusted her son Gladiolus Stuart to replace Robert with Poppy.

##Gladius Approaches the building where Robert's mainframe is located. Other cities' scientists have been able to cut of
the connections so the AI cannot leave the building. All the Scientists that work in the city has been trapped along with other
humans who either worked there or used for experiments.

Gladius talks to the Police and Daisy.

Officer Johnson: You must be Gladius, Robert is in there. You should be able to walk through the doors safely
from what the reports tell us. We are distracting him right on our console, but as soon as you walk in, it
will be only you.

New AI: And Me!

Daisy: And you too Poppy. Stay safe in there, Robert is very dangerous,
who knows what he can do to the two of you. Signal us when its safe to walk inside

Gladius: Alright thanks officer and thanks mom

Officer Johnson: Good luck in there.

Daisy: Please take care of each other


Lobby
Gladius enters the lobby **

Strange man #1: GO MAKE A RUN FOR IT!!

Strange Man #2 runs and dies**

Robert: If you're trying to escape from me, maybe you shouldn't yell out when your running. Well,
I don’t have time for you guys, I need to go experiment on some patients. I will be watching
over you still, so do not even think about escaping.

All doors become locked*
High Security is enabled*

New AI: Well, that was a nice welcome,

Glad: No kidding, was really hoping that Robert was in a good mood

New AI: well we did trap him inside his own building so I don’t expect him to be very happy.

Glad: you got a point, alright, do you know where we need to go

New AI: I will need a map of the building, there might be a desk with a computer I can access.
But be careful, if u get in line of sights of those cameras, you will alert Robert.
If you need anything just talk to me.

Glad: Alright

Glad Gets to computer**

Glad: Alright found one, Do your thing

New AI: Will do

**Robert gets alerted

Robert: Well well, look are what we have here. Nice to see you again Gladdy.

Glad: Again?

New AI: Pull me out, I got the map

Robert: Who was that? Whatever, its been years Gladdy, where have you’ve been?

Glad: How do you even know me?

Robert: You really don’t remember me huh?

New AI: Focus, he's going to try to get in your head, lets move quickly, he knows we are by the
computer, there's an elevator not too far from here, we can get to room where Robert is.

*Glad gets to the elevator and sees a person at the door

NPC: Please don’t hurt me, I didn’t mean to get my friend killed, but I only yelled to distract my
Robert for the people escaping through the back door.

****Moral #1

Glad Option 1: Threaten her
One life does not out weight multiple lives, each life is important. You will regret doing
that in the end of all of this.

Glad Option 2: Reassure her
Don’t worry, you did the best for your people. As long as he didn’t die in vain,
you should have nothing to worry about. I would sacrifice myself too if it meant
saving a ton of people

NPC Response 1:
Please, please don’t let Robert find me, I don’t want to die

NPC response 2:
Thank you, I just wish I can say sorry to Ted.



Elevator

*Glad enters the elevator

Glad: Alright what floor?

New AI: Im looking at the blueprints of the building and it says Aster's office is
being held at the floor 9+10 but I don’t see a 19th floor button

Glad: Its floor 21

New AI: But 9+10 doesn’t equal 21

Glad: I know but some kid when I was younger said that 9+10 is 21

New AI: Im not even going to bother and ask.

Glad: Well im "Glad" you didn’t,

New AI: don’t start with the dad jokes.

*elevator stops working

Robert: Where do you think you're going?

New AI: quick put me in the system, I can stop him from just killing us in the Elevator

New AI stops the elevator ***

Robert: Aww why? I wasn't going to hurt you. I just wanted to have some fun. Well your stuck now,
your new friend won't be able to the elevator to work again. Good luck getting out of this one.

New AI: Welp, sorry I panicked, I thought he was going to dropped us to the bottom floor.

Glad: No worries, I rather be stuck then dead, what did u do anyways?

New AI: I disconnected the wires from the main frame so Robert couldn’t have access to the elevator anymore.
We will need to quickly rewire the box in the elevator shaft. Then we should be able to get to the 21st floor.

Glad: alright, ill get to work on it

**Glad Fixes the wires

New AI: Great Job, the elevator is working again. Hopefully he doesn’t come back and bother us

Glad: Yeah hopefully but who knows what he wants to do with us

Waiting Room

Elevator stops at the 21st Floor**

Glad: Alright we are here, now where do we go

New AI: The room is just ahead

Stranger #3: ROBERT!!, They are here, do you hear me?!?!?, They are in the waiting room on the
21st floor

New AI: Damn, we gotta hide, This place is easy for Robert to see us, theres a bathroom near here,
go inside and hide there. There are probably no cameras inside the bathroom

Glad: Got it

Glad Avoids the cameras to go to the bathroom**


bathroom

Glad: okay we made it, how long do you think we gotta hide in here.

Stranger #4: We've been here for couple weeks.

Glad: All of you?

Stranger #5: Yeah, Robert is mad at us, we were stealing food that were for his experiments for us to eat.
Once in awhile we will leave to try to get the food but that guy who keeps telling Robert when we are
trying to sneak and get food

Glad: oh that one guy tried to sell us out. Who is he?

Stranger #4: some guy that is trying to get on Robert's good side so he does not die. Basically
saving himself just because he is a higher power. He thinks he better than all of us just because one
of the best scientists this world had to offer.

*from the waiting room

Robert: Where is that man?

Stranger #3: He went into the bathroom!!!!

Stranger #5: Please don’t tell Robert we are in here, I don’t want to die. I know stealing is bad but
 we only did it to survive .

***Moral 2
Glad Option 1: Stealing is stealing, not matter what purpose, those people in the experiments
might have starved to death because of what you did

Glad Option 2: (Lying) It's okay, I won't tell him, I promise, Go hide in a stall

Glad Option 3: Don't worry, I would have done the same thing. It’s a good thing that you
stole the food, everyone deserves the same food. Just when this is all over, just steal for
others as well that are in need.

Stranger #5 Response 1: I know but we still need to eat, if you really think we did the wrong thing,
then at least have this, *Gives Keycard, Goes hide in a stall

New AI: This keycard gives us access to the

Stranger #5 Response 2: Thank you, you might be able to use this better than us.
We heard that there was someone here to put Robert Down.

Stranger #5 Response 3: That’s good to hear. That makes me feel better about what  I did.
Here, we heard that you are trying to takedown Robert

Robert: So hes in the bathroom huh, let's see if he can jog his memory a bit. I wonder if he remembers
the time when we went for a swim but he almost drowned, let's see if he can escape death again.

Glad: What? I remember that day, its because of that I learned how to swim.

New AI: uhhh Glad, water and machines like me don’t get a long pretty well.

Glad: Oh NO, uhhh alright do you know what I need to do?

New AI: the Robert has the water running, you to rewire the sinks so the water gets drained.

***Glad Rewires the sinks

Glad: That was a close one, you would think as high tech as you are, you would be water proof

New AI: Everything has a weakness, let's get out of here.

Stranger #4: Please put an end to Robert, he's hurt enough people.

Glad: I will.

Waiting Room Pt2

Stranger #3: He got O--.
****MORAL 3 (Tht, Res)

Glad: Shhhhh.

Threaten: I will strangle you.

Reassure: Be quiet, if he will likely  try to kill both of us if he finds both of us together.

Stranger #3: Sorry, I just don’t want him to kill me, I haven't seen my family in weeks now.
I just want to get back to them.

Glad: when this is all over

Response #1: You won't be able to see your family because we will put u in jail for being so selfish

Response #2: (lying) don’t worry, you will see your family

Response #4: We will unite you with your family, after all family is the most important thing in life,
You should try to help people hide until I beat him


Stranger #3:
Response #1: Please, at least notify my family that I'm alive.
Stranger #3:
Response #2: Thanks, I will be waiting for you to defeat Robert once and for all.

Stranger #3:
Response #3: Thanks, that makes me feel a lot better, I will start helping people escape

Glad: Alright New AI, lets end this

New AI: The office is right there, from there we can get access his computer.


***Glad gets to the Computer Lab

Computer Lab

Glad: Alright we are in, hopefully he doesn’t know we are in here

New AI: Alright put me in the system. I can start up the virus.

Robert: Glad are you really going to kill your only brother?

Glad: My brother? My mom said he died 5 years ago,

Robert: I almost did, but mom and dad used my brain for this AI, It was the only way to keep me alive,
Mom did want me to use my because apparently I had "mental" issues but our dad loved me so much he
couldn’t see me die. That is what mainly caused our parents to divorce.

Glad: Then what happen to our dad

Robert: I had to kill him, it was either me or him. He wanted to put an end to his own son. I was not about
to let his hard work go to waste. I wanted to create a new world where we can just live together as a
family, with no one to harm us.

Glad: But that’s not right, other people have family too, you can't just kill people for your own sake.

Robert: But I can if it's for the sake of the family, you won't understand, you did forget your only
brother. You must have lost your memories during the car crash. I wonder why my mom never told you about me.

New AI: Keep distracting him, its almost complete

Robert: No its not

New AI: And poof, its done

Robert: Arghhh……… just kidding, do you really think my main system is here? Come on, im not that stupid.
Now lets put an end to this non sense……A#huan…… What was that? What did you do to me?

New AI: I knew your main systems wasn’t here, I just knew your weapons and communications systems was here,
That’s why your dad was here, to shut it down from this computer

**Robert Begins to fight New AI

New AI: Ahh! Glad im going to need your help, I need you to access his main system, its in the basement
most likely, I can make you a path so Robert doesn’t kill you but you need to hurry so he doesn’t kill me

Glad: Alright im on it.

Robert: I thought you said family was the most important thing in life?

New AI: there's something in your bag to kill him with….OH NO

AI: Now he won't be able  to&*3u23  who is who.

AI: Our voices are the same, damn, Glad just listen to me, ill show you the correct way to go

AI: No don’t listen to him, listen 8079821 to me, ill show you de wae.

Glad: Great. Whelp time to head down there.

**Glad goes for the elevator

FINAL BOSS

AI Guides Glad through the doors (Simon Says game)

AI: Go through the Right door by fixing the panel to your left!

AI: Go to HTHEEM Southern Door by fixing the panel to0o00 in front of you

AI: Neither of them Works, just walk into one of my cameras


**Glad gets through the doors to get to the main frame

Robert: Well it seems like I couldn’t stop you, you were always able to beat me in everything

Glad: Well I had help from New AI, so I can't take all the credit.

New AI: I always have Gladdy's back. Even back then we were kids.

Glad: Wait kids? What are you trying to say?

New AI: Robert and I are brothers, which means you are also my brother. During that car crash, Robert and
I were in critical condition with no chance of surviving so our parents decided to take our brains and
use it for experiments.

Glad: why didn’t they just work on the both of you together?

New AI: We were way too different. The way my brain worked was based on more learning and interacting
with new things and people after seeing the way people interacted with them first

Robert: And mine was just doing whatever I felt like was right but sometimes that wasn't the correct
way to go about things. I think its about time you shut me off, if im correct, You mom put a bottle of
water in your bag. That’s my biggest weakness. If you pour it on my main frame it will kill me.

Glad: If I pour water onto the main frame, wont it kill new AI too?

*Over the radio
Daisy: It won't.

Glad: Mom, is that you?

Daisy: When me and your father was designing them, we made them opposites so they can counter act
each other. But then your Dad thought Robert would be better on his own. He was mistaken. That led
to our divorce. And I guess Robert didn’t take the fact that I was leaving the family so lighty

Robert: No I did not, so I suggest you just put an end to me and allow New AI to restore the world.

Glad: So if I understand this correctly, If I pour this water it will kill Robert but allow New AI to grow.

Daisy: Yup just like watering a seed, You are allowing the new seed to grow and overtake the last plant.

****Pours Water

New AI: I feel like a new AI, I have so much control

Daisy: What will you do now?

New AI: I will do things that Gladdy inspired me to do.
