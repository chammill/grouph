Far into the future of earth's existence, Humans has drained the earth of most of its natural resources.
Food resources has now been limited. Water has become a non-renewable resource.
Plants and trees are very hard to come by since they all have been chopped down and used for fuel or compost.
 The only plants are in man-made greenhouses in populated cities.
There are many abandoned cities throughout the world because of the food shortages. 

A Scientist that goes by the name of Aster Scott has created an AI to help restore the earth of its resources.
It would tear down the abandoned cities and recycle the materials used and plant trees
and food to jump start nature again.
Although, this AI was created by using the mind of the Jacob's Eldest son, Robert Scott.
This allows the AI to have human characteristics such as emotions and the ability to think.
After he was created into an AI,he began tearing down cities and restoring some of earth's natural resources at the abandoned cities.

But a few months later, he began tearing down populated cities.
This left many humans dead or homeless in a world where resources and cities are hard to come by. Other
Cities are taking precautions to stop the AI. A scientist named Daisy Stuart created another AI to replace Robert.
 She also created an AI that was made from a human. This was Poppy Stuart,
Daisy Youngest child. Rosa as now entrusted her son Gladiolus Stuart to replace Robert with Poppy.
